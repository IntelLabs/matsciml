The Open MatSciML Toolkit comprises a framework and benchmark suite for AI-accelerated materials discovery,
with a strong emphasis on a low barrier to entry and continuity across laptops to high performance computing clusters.
The toolkit provides access to state-of-the-art model architectures like MACE, FAENet, and GemNet,
coupled with a broad range of datasets including but not limited to `Open Catalyst`_, the `Materials Project`_,
and `NOMAD`_, and alongside an end-to-end modular pipeline for experimentation and development.

Getting started
----------------

If you are looking to get started with working on the Open MatSciML Toolkit, we highly recommend
you peruse the documentation. A good place to start is seeing what :ref:`Datasets` and :ref:`Models`
are supported by the toolkit. If any pique your interest, check out the `Github examples <https://github.com/IntelLabs/matsciml/tree/main/examples>`_
folder, which can be a good place to get up and running. Once you've got your teeth sunk into the
general functionality of the toolkit, check out :ref:`Best practices` for additional functionality
of the toolkit. If you're stuck, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion on Github!
When you're ready, checkout the :ref:`Developers guide` to see how you can contribute to the toolkit!

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section is a work in progress, for now we defer you to the `Github readme <https://github.com/IntelLabs/matsciml/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation>`_
for installation instructions.
