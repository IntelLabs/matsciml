        """
        Implements a batch-based or dynamic quantile loss function.

        This loss function uses user-defined quantiles and associated
        weights for training: the high-level idea is to allow flexibility
        in optimizing model performance against certain outliers, and
        ensuring that the model generalizes well.

        The function will either use the target values, or the norm of
        the target values (more meaningful for vector quantities like
        forces) to compute quantile values based on bins requested. A weight
        tensor is then generated (with the same shape as the targets) to
        weight predicted vs. actual margins, as computed with ``loss_func``.
        The mean of the weighted loss is then returned.

        In the case of ``loss_func='huber'``, the ``huber_delta`` argument specifies
        the margin used to switch between MAE and MSE losses. This value
        is applied globally (i.e. regardless of the quantile).

        Parameters
        ----------
        quantile_weights : dict[float, float]
            Dictionary mapping of quantile and the weighting to ascribe
            to that bin. Values smaller than the first bin, and larger
            than the last bin take on these respective values, while
            quantile in between bin ranges include the lower quantile
            and up to (not including) the next bin.
        loss_func : Callable | Literal['mse', 'mae', 'rmse', 'huber']
            Actual metric function. If a string literal is given, then
            one of the built-in PyTorch functional losses are used
            based on either MSE, RMSE, or Huber loss. If a ``Callable``
            is passed, the output **must** be of the same dimension
            as the targets, i.e. the behavior of ``keepdim`` or no
            reduction, as the weights are applied afterwards.
        use_norm : bool, default True
            Whether to use the norm of targets, instead of an elementwise
            wise application. This makes sense for vector quantities that
            are coupled, e.g. force vectors. If ``False``, this will still
            work with scalar and vector quantities-alike, but requires an
            intuition for one over the other.
        huber_delta : float, optional
            If ``loss_func`` is set to 'huber', this value is used as the
            ``delta`` argument in ``torch.nn.functional.huber_loss``, which
            corresponds to the margin between MAE/L1 and MSE functions.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError:
            Currently RMSE is not implemented, and will trigger this
            exception.
